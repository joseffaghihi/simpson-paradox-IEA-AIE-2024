This paper demonstrates how probabilistic fuzzy logic provides a flexible and sound framework for analyzing causality. Initially, we identify a limitation associated with the conventional Average Treatment Effect (ATE) methodology for non-binary treatments, which requires
a threshold to segregate treatment values into treatment and control groups. This dichotomy becomes problematic near the threshold, where it is unreasonable to categorize similar values distinctly into treatment or
control groups. We propose the Fuzzy Average Treatment Effect (FATE) as a generalization of ATE to address this issue, ensuring a smoother transition between groups. To address this, we adopt a probabilistic fuzzy
perspective, which allows us to tackle questions like: "What is the probability of selecting a value of a random variable T to be high, equal to t?" Moreover, we explore the resolution of Simpsonâ€™s paradox, exemplifying the shortcomings of traditional probability and statistics theories,
thereby underscoring the advantages of our approach.
